# Case study: How a bike sharing make a fast success being possible?
This case study was made to show my data analysis hard and soft skills and it was based on the [Google data analytics certificate](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone) case study, so i applied all the knowledge i acquired in the whole course. Plus, there are some topics i will not dive into, since i'm a beginner analyst.

## Tools used
- MySql: database manager
- Sql: for data manipulating
- R: for data analysing
- Tableau: for data visualizations

## Fictional scenario
The fictional company called Cyclistic has launched a succeed offer about bike sharing. Since then, the program increase to a 5,800 bicycles fleet with geografic traffic and almost 700 stations at Chicago. In which x% of bicycle customers are casual memeber, not having any conexion, and x% has paid annually the annual offers. With this data about the customers, the next goal of the company is to tranfer the maximum casual customers to pay the annual offer.

So my task is to collect, prepare, analyse the data and share with stakeholder team all the insights i found about the convenient data, so the stakeholders will analyse and validate my insights, in order to make the company apply the best strategies.
